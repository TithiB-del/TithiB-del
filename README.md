### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
currently typing in the template coz I have an underdeveloped profile-may update later!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on hackathons & open source projects! Will be venturing into other ways of contributing soon!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things at once to be honest. I love to learn, and that is quite apparent with all the repositories and work you may see here
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects- am quite new to it and am still learning some new tech stack, but am willing to get my hands dirty on this stuff!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a few occasional problems, which I generally look upto google to resolve XD
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about almost anything! I love meeting new peeps & connecting with them, while resolving conflicts!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my social media handles are in my personal website(
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I dont really care much-use whatever you like!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love owls & am quite lazier than what I seem to be xD
